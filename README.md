## Introduction

Do you ever wonder about the species of plants around you? The Plant Recognition with MobileNetV2 project is here to help! Our solution leverages the MobileNetV2 architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, to classify various plant species based on images. This repository provides code for training, fine-tuning, and making predictions using the model.

## Setup

To dive into the world of plant recognition, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-recognition.git
   cd plant-recognition
   ```

## Data Preparation

Prepare your own custom dataset to unleash the full potential of plant recognition. Organize your data as follows:

```
your-custom-dataset/
|-- train/
|   |-- class_1/
|   |   |-- image1.jpg
|   |   |-- image2.jpg
|   |-- class_2/
|   |   |-- image3.jpg
|   |   |-- image4.jpg
|-- test/
|   |-- class_1/
|   |   |-- image5.jpg
|   |   |-- image6.jpg
|   |-- class_2/
|   |   |-- image7.jpg
|   |   |-- image8.jpg
```

Adjust the paths in the code according to your dataset structure.

## Training

Train the model by executing the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

Feel free to tweak the hyperparameters in the script to achieve the best results.

## Inference

See the magic happen with the inference script:

```bash
python inference.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify.

## Results

Visualize the training and validation metrics using the provided scripts. Marvel at the accuracy and gain insights into the recognition capabilities of your model.
